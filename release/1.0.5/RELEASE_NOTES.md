# Sprout 1.0.5

Release date: 2026-02-18

## What's Changed

### Cards and customisation

- Additional styles and full Custom Reading style support planned for a future update

### Settings and guide

- Updated in-app guide surfaced directly within Obsidian

### Fixes
- Modal background/overlay scoped to workspace so tab-switching remains available

## In development

- Continued bug-fix and stability updates
- Reading view enhancements and additional style support
- Codebase tidy-up focused on extensibility
