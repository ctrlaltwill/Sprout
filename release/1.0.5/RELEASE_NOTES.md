# Sprout 1.0.5

Release date: 2026-02-18

This is the formal 1.0.5 stable release and builds on the 1.0.5-beta.1 pre-release.

## Added
- New card types: multi-select MCQ and ordered questions for memorising sequences
- Card customisation improvements: typed cloze and image occlusion mask customisation
- Reading view overhaul with two styles: Flashcards and Clean markdown
- New settings view with more control
- Updated guide made visible directly within Obsidian

## Fixed
- Modal background/overlay is now limited to the workspace so tab-switching remains available

## Development focus after 1.0.5
1. Bug fixes and stability hardening
2. Mobile functionality support (in development)
3. Reading view improvements and style expansion
4. Codebase tidy-up to support long-term extensibility

## Note
If scheduling or analytics data appears missing after update, restore from backup.
