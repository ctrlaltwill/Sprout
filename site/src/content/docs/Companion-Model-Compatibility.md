This table tracks which Companion features work with each provider and model. Only models with reported test data are listed.

Some results were generated from automated tests, so individual experiences may vary. If you believe something is inaccurate, please submit a pull request to update the table.

Linked notes are not tracked as a separate compatibility column because they are sent as plain text context.

## How to test and contribute

If you test a provider/model that is not listed, you can submit a pull request to add it.

### What to test

1. **Chat** — Open Companion and ask it to review your note. This should provide a chat response.
2. **Edit** — Open Companion, after asking it to review your note, ask it to implement changes. If it generates changes that you can accept into your document then that is correct.
3. **Generate Flashcards** — Open Companion and ask it to generate flashcards from a note. Confirm cards appear and can be inserted into your note.
4. **Generate Tests** — Open the Tests feature and generate a short test from a note. Confirm questions appear and are answerable. Complete the test, and confirm that the test is appropriately graded.
5. **File Attachments** — Embed or link a PDF or image in a note, enable `Include embedded attachments` in settings. Confirm the model processes the attachment without errors.

### How to submit your results

1. Fork the repository and edit `site/src/content/docs/Companion-Model-Compatibility.md`.
2. Add a new row for the provider and model you tested, then mark each feature with ✅ (works) or ❌ (does not work).
3. Add a short comment if there are caveats (e.g. "Intermittent error 400 messages").
4. Open a pull request with the provider, model, and a brief summary of what you tested.
