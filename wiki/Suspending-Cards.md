# Suspending Cards

Last modified: 13/02/2026

## Overview

Suspending removes a card from study sessions until you unsuspend it.

The card is kept in your collection, but it is not shown for review.

Unlike burying, suspension does not reset automatically.

## How to suspend a card

### During a study session

- Press **`S`** on your keyboard, or
- Open the **More menu** (press `M` or tap **⋮**) and choose **Suspend**.

### From the Card Browser

1. Open the [[Card-Browser|Card Browser]].
2. Select one or more cards.
3. Click the **Suspend** button in the bulk actions bar.

To unsuspend, select suspended cards and click **Unsuspend**.

## Finding suspended cards

In [[Card-Browser|Card Browser]], filter by **Stage → Suspended**.

## When to suspend

Suspending is useful when:

- A card is outdated or incorrect and you want to stop reviewing it until you fix the content.
- You're studying a subset of material (e.g. only certain chapters) and want to temporarily exclude other cards.
- A card is a leech (you keep forgetting it) and you need to rewrite it before continuing.

## Suspending vs burying

| | Bury | Suspend |
|--|------|---------|
| **Duration** | Until midnight (automatic reset) | Until you manually unsuspend |
| **Best for** | Skipping a card for the rest of the day | Removing a card from reviews long-term |
| **Scheduling impact** | None | None |
| **How to reverse** | Automatic (next day) | Manual (unsuspend in browser or during study) |

> [!TIP]
> Use **Bury** for "I'll try again tomorrow" and **Suspend** for "I need to fix this card first."
