# Widget

Last updated: 13/02/2026

## Overview

The Sprout widget is a sidebar panel that gives you quick access to your decks and study sessions without navigating to the full study page. It shows a tree of your decks with card counts and lets you start a session with one click.

## Opening the widget

The widget lives in Obsidian's sidebar. Click the Sprout icon in the left sidebar to open (or close) the widget panel.

## Deck tree

The widget displays your decks as a collapsible tree. Each deck shows:

- **Deck name**
- **Due count** — Number of cards due for review
- **New count** — Number of new cards available

Click a deck to start a study session for that scope.

## Scope modes

The widget supports two scope modes, configurable in the widget header:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **Folder** | Decks are organised by the folder structure of your vault. Each folder containing notes with cards becomes a deck. |
| **Note** | Each note with cards is shown as a separate deck. |

Toggle between modes using the scope selector at the top of the widget.

## Folder notes as decks

When **Treat folder notes as decks** is enabled (Settings → Study → Widget), folder notes act as the deck root for their containing folder. This means the folder note's cards are grouped with the folder's other notes into one deck.

## Starting a session

Click any deck in the widget tree to immediately start a study session scoped to that deck. The session opens in the main content area.

## Summary view

After completing a session, the widget shows a summary:

- Cards reviewed
- Time spent
- Accuracy (percentage of Good/Easy grades)

## Tips

- The widget is most useful when pinned to the sidebar for quick access between notes.
- Use **Folder** mode if your vault is organised by subject/topic folders.
- Use **Note** mode if you want to study individual notes.
