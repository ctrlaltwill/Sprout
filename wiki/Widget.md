## Overview

The Sprout widget is a sidebar panel for quick access to decks and study sessions.

It shows a deck tree with counts and lets you start studying in one click.

## Opening the widget

Click the Sprout icon in Obsidian's left sidebar to open or close the widget.

## Deck tree

The widget displays your decks as a collapsible tree. Each deck shows:

- **Deck name**
- **Due count** — Number of cards due for review
- **New count** — Number of new cards available

Click a deck to start a study session for that scope.

## Scope modes

Choose a mode in the widget header:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **Folder** | Decks are organised by the folder structure of your vault. Each folder containing notes with cards becomes a deck. |
| **Note** | Each note with cards is shown as a separate deck. |

Switching mode changes how decks are grouped, but does not change card data.

## Folder notes as decks

When **Treat folder notes as decks** is enabled, a folder note becomes the deck root for that folder.

Its cards are grouped with other cards from the same folder.

## Starting a session

Click any deck in the widget tree to immediately start a study session scoped to that deck. The session opens in the main content area.

## Summary view

After completing a session, the widget shows a summary:

- Cards reviewed
- Time spent
- Accuracy (percentage of Good/Easy grades)

## Tips

- The widget is most useful when pinned to the sidebar for quick access between notes.
- Use **Folder** mode if your vault is organised by subject/topic folders.
- Use **Note** mode if you want to study individual notes.
