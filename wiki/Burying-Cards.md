# Burying Cards

Last updated: 13/02/2026

## Overview

Burying a card postpones it until the next day. The card is removed from the current session and will reappear tomorrow. Burying does **not** affect the card's scheduling data — its stability, difficulty, and interval remain unchanged.

## How to bury a card

### During a study session

- Press **`B`** on your keyboard, or
- Open the **More menu** (press `M` or tap **⋮**) and choose **Bury**.

### From the skip prompt

If you skip a card three times in one session, Sprout offers a **"Bury for today?"** prompt:

- Press **`B`** to bury the card.
- Press **`Escape`** to dismiss the prompt and keep the card in the queue.

## When buried cards return

Buried cards are automatically un-buried at **midnight** (local time). They will appear in your next study session as normal.

## Checking buried cards

You can see which cards are buried in the [[Card Browser]] by filtering with the **Stage** filter set to **Buried**.

## When to bury

Burying is useful when:

- You keep seeing a card you can't recall and want a fresh attempt tomorrow.
- A card is interfering with your current session (e.g. you're frustrated or distracted).
- You want to skip a card temporarily without affecting its scheduling.

> [!NOTE]
> Burying only lasts until midnight. If you want to remove a card from reviews permanently, use [[Suspending Cards|Suspend]] instead.
