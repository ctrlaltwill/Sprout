# Burying Cards

Last modified: 13/02/2026

## What burying does

Burying removes a card from today’s session and brings it back tomorrow.
It does **not** reset or change scheduling values (interval, stability, difficulty).

## How to bury

During review:

- press `B`, or
- open the More menu and choose **Bury**.

If you skip the same card three times in one session, Sprout offers a **Bury for today?** prompt.

## When cards return

Buried cards are automatically unburied at local midnight.

## Check buried cards

Open [[Card Browser]] and filter **Stage = Buried**.

## Limits and related behavior

- Burying is temporary (today only).
- Burying does not delete cards.
- For long-term removal from review, use [[Suspending Cards|Suspend]].
