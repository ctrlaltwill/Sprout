## Where you can edit cards

You can edit cards in:
- the source note,
- an active study session, or
- the [[Card Browser]].

Changes are applied when saved and then picked up by sync.

## Editing in the source note

Open the note that contains the card block and edit the fields directly.

- In source/editing view, edit raw Markdown.
- In reading view, use the card edit button to jump into editing.

Save the file after changes.

## Editing while studying

You can edit the current card without leaving review:

1. Press **`E`** on your keyboard, or
2. Open the **More menu** (press **`M`** or tap the **⋮** button) and choose **Edit**.

This opens the inline editor. Changes save immediately and update the current session.

## Editing from the Card Browser

1. Open the [[Card Browser]].
2. Select one card or multiple cards.
3. Click **Edit** to open the card editor.

The browser table updates as you edit.

## What can be edited

All card fields can be changed:

| Field | Editable |
|---|---|
| Title | ✅ |
| Question / Cloze text | ✅ |
| Answer | ✅ |
| Options (MCQ) | ✅ |
| Extra info | ✅ |
| Groups | ✅ |

## Critical warning

> [!WARNING]
> Do not edit or delete `^sprout-#########` anchors. If an anchor is removed, that card is treated as new at sync and previous learning progress is lost.

## Editing Image Occlusion cards

Image Occlusion cards use the IO Editor modal. You can add, move, resize, and delete masks there. See [[Image Occlusion]].

> [!NOTE]
> The IO Editor is desktop-only. On mobile, you will see a notice.
