## What this page shows

Analytics gives you a quick view of your study activity and card health.
Open it from the **Analytics** sidebar item or the command palette.

## Top summary cards

At the top, Sprout shows four key metrics:

- **Longest streak**: Your best run of consecutive study days. Shows **Live** if you are currently matching it.
- **Current streak**: How many days in a row you have studied, including today.
- **Daily time**: Average minutes per day for the last 7 days, plus trend vs the previous 7 days.
- **Daily cards**: Average cards reviewed per day for the last 7 days, plus trend vs the previous 7 days.

## Charts

Analytics includes charts for workload, recall, and scheduling trends.
For chart-by-chart details, see [[Charts]].

## Filters

Use filters at the top to narrow data:

- **Time range**: last 7, 30, 90 days, or all time.
- **Scope**: specific deck, folder, or group.

Important behavior:

- Filters apply to all charts at the same time.
- If filters are too narrow, charts can appear empty. This is expected.

## Layout

The page adapts to window size.
Use **Expand / Collapse** to switch between full-width and constrained layout.
