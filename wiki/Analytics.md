# Analytics

The Analytics dashboard gives you a visual overview of your study habits and card data. Open it from the **Analytics** leaf in the sidebar.

## KPI cards

Four summary cards appear at the top of the dashboard.

| Card | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Longest streak** | Your all-time longest run of consecutive study days. Shows a **Live** badge if your current streak equals the longest. |
| **Current streak** | Consecutive study days including today. Shows **Live** if you've reviewed today. |
| **Daily time** | Average minutes per day over the last 7 days, with a trend arrow comparing to the prior 7 days. |
| **Daily cards** | Average cards per day over the last 7 days, with a trend arrow comparing to the prior 7 days. |

## Charts

### Review Calendar Heatmap

A 365-day grid (7 rows × 52 weeks) coloured by review activity. Darker cells = more reviews. Hover over a cell to see the date and count.

### Stage Distribution

A pie chart showing how your cards are distributed across stages: New, Learning, Review, Relearning, and Suspended.

### Future Due (Study Forecast)

A 30-day bar chart forecasting how many cards will become due each day.

### Answer Buttons

A 30-day stacked bar chart showing how many times you pressed Again, Hard, Good, and Easy each day.

### New Cards Per Day

A 30-day chart of how many new cards were introduced each day.

### Stability Distribution

A histogram of card stability values across your collection — higher stability means longer intervals.

### Forgetting Curve

Plots your actual retention against the theoretical forgetting curve to show how well the scheduler is calibrated.

## Layout

The dashboard is responsive — KPI cards and charts reflow from 1 to 2 to 4 columns depending on window width. Use the **Expand / Collapse** toggle to switch between full-width and a constrained layout.
