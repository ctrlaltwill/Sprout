## Overview

The Analytics dashboard gives you a visual overview of your study habits and card data. Open it from the **Analytics** leaf in the sidebar or via the command palette.

## KPI cards

Four summary cards appear at the top of the dashboard:

| Card | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Longest streak** | Your all-time longest run of consecutive study days. Shows a **Live** badge if your current streak equals the longest. |
| **Current streak** | Consecutive study days including today. Shows **Live** if you've reviewed today. |
| **Daily time** | Average minutes per day over the last 7 days, with a trend arrow comparing to the prior 7 days. |
| **Daily cards** | Average cards per day over the last 7 days, with a trend arrow comparing to the prior 7 days. |

## Charts overview

The dashboard includes several charts to help you understand your study patterns. See [[Charts]] for a detailed explanation of each chart, what it measures, and how to interpret the data.

Charts included:
- Review Calendar Heatmap
- Stage Distribution (pie chart)
- Future Due (study forecast)
- Answer Buttons
- New Cards Per Day
- Stability Distribution
- Forgetting Curve

## Layout

The dashboard is responsive — KPI cards and charts reflow from 1 to 2 to 4 columns depending on window width. Use the **Expand / Collapse** toggle to switch between full-width and a constrained layout.

## Filters

Use the filter controls at the top of the dashboard to narrow the data:

- **Time range** — Filter by date range (last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, all time).
- **Scope** — Filter by deck, folder, or group.

Filters apply to all charts simultaneously.
