# Reading View Styles

Last modified: 15/02/2026

## Overview

This page explains the four built-in Reading View macro styles in Sprout.

Use **Settings → Reading → Macro styles** to switch between them.

## 1) Flashcards

- Purpose: fastest active-recall view.
- Behavior: flip interaction (question face ↔ answer face).
- Best for: quick recall blocks.
- Typical layout: masonry.

## 2) Classic

- Purpose: structured card sections.
- Behavior: collapsible sections with chevrons.
- Best for: cards where you want progressive reveal.
- Typical layout: masonry.

## 3) Guidebook

- Purpose: walkthrough / step-by-step reading.
- Behavior: section carousel with navigation controls.
- Best for: explanatory cards and sequential learning.
- Typical layout: vertical.

## 4) Clean markdown

- Purpose: minimal note-like rendering.
- Behavior: low chrome, clean text flow.
- Best for: reading-heavy material and concise review.
- Typical layout: vertical.

## Field and colour controls

- **Reading view fields** are saved per macro style.
- **Reading view colours** are also per style (except Flashcards).
- This keeps each style standalone so changes on one style do not affect others.
