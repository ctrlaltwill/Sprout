# Reading View Styles

Last modified: 16/02/2026

## Overview

This page explains the Reading View macro styles in Sprout.

Use **Settings → Reading → Macro styles** to switch between them.

## Card Styles

Currently available:

- **Disabled**: turns off Sprout card styling and uses native Obsidian reading rendering.
- **Flashcards**: fastest active-recall view with flip interaction (question face ↔ answer face).
- **Clean markdown**: minimal note-like rendering with low chrome and clean text flow.

Planned for a future update:

- **Classic**: structured card sections with progressive reveal.
- **Guidebook**: walkthrough / step-by-step reading layout.
- **Custom**: user-defined CSS styling with dedicated hook classes.

### Flashcards

- Purpose: fastest active-recall view.
- Behavior: flip interaction (question face ↔ answer face).
- Best for: quick recall blocks.
- Typical layout: masonry.

### Clean markdown

- Purpose: minimal note-like rendering.
- Behavior: low chrome, clean text flow.
- Best for: reading-heavy material and concise review.
- Typical layout: vertical.

## Configuration

- **Reading view fields** are configured and saved per style.
- **Reading view colours** are also per style (except Flashcards).
- This keeps each style standalone, so changes on one style do not affect others.

## Next step

Classic, Guidebook, and Custom are planned for a future release. See [[Custom Reading Styles]] for Custom plans.
