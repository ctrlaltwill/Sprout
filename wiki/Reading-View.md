# Reading View

Last updated: 13/02/2026

## Overview

Reading View controls how your flashcard blocks appear when viewing notes in Obsidian's reading mode (as opposed to source/editing mode). Sprout renders card blocks as styled card components so they look clean and readable inline with your notes.

## What's shown in reading view

In reading view, card blocks are rendered with:

- **Card type badge** — Shows whether it's a Basic, Cloze, MCQ, IO, or Ordered card.
- **Question/answer fields** — Nicely formatted with proper Markdown rendering.
- **Edit button** — Click to open the card editor without switching to source view.
- **Groups** — Displayed as tags beneath the card.

## Appearance settings

You can customise how cards look in reading view in **Settings → Preview**:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Card style** | Choose between different visual styles for how card blocks are rendered |
| **Show card borders** | Toggle the border around card blocks |
| **Show card type badge** | Toggle the type indicator (Basic, Cloze, etc.) |
| **Compact mode** | Reduce spacing for a denser layout |

## Interaction

- **Edit button** — Opens the card editor for that specific card.
- **Cloze hints** — In reading view, cloze deletions can optionally show hints or blanks.
- **Images** — Embedded images are rendered inline within the card.
- **LaTeX** — Mathematical expressions are rendered using Obsidian's built-in LaTeX support.

## Tips

- Reading view is useful for reviewing your card content in context alongside your notes.
- Use it to quickly spot formatting issues or incomplete cards.
- Click the edit button on any card to fix issues without switching to source view.
