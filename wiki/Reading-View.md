# Reading View

Last modified: 13/02/2026

## Overview

Reading View controls how Sprout card blocks look in Obsidian reading mode.

It does not change card data. It only changes how cards are displayed while reading notes.

## What's shown in reading view

In reading mode, Sprout can show:

- Card type badge (Basic, Cloze, MCQ, IO, Ordered).
- Formatted card fields.
- Edit button for quick edits.
- Group tags.

## Appearance settings

Change these in **Settings → Preview**:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Card style** | Select card block style |
| **Show card borders** | Show or hide borders |
| **Show card type badge** | Show or hide type badge |
| **Compact mode** | Reduce spacing |

## Interaction

- **Edit button** opens the card editor for that card.
- Cloze cards can show hints or blanks, based on your settings.
- Embedded images render inline.
- Math uses Obsidian LaTeX rendering.

## Tips

- Use Reading View to spot formatting problems before studying.
- If a card looks wrong, use Edit directly from the card block.
- If a card block does not render as expected, check card syntax and run a sync.
