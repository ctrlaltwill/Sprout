# Language Settings

Last modified: 13/02/2026

## Overview

These settings control text-to-speech (TTS) in **Settings → Audio**.

## Available settings

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **TTS Language** | The language/locale for the TTS voice (e.g. `en-US`, `en-GB`, `fr-FR`, `de-DE`). |
| **Voice** | The specific voice to use. Available voices depend on your operating system and installed voice packs. |
| **Speech rate** | How fast the text is read (0.5× to 2.0×). Default is 1.0×. |
| **Pitch** | Voice pitch adjustment. Default is 1.0. |

## Script-based voice selection

Sprout can map different voices to different writing scripts (for example Latin, Cyrillic, CJK, Arabic).

How it works:
- Sprout examines the script (alphabet) of the card text and selects the voice you have assigned to that script.
- Sprout cannot distinguish languages that share the same script. Example: a Latin-script word shared by English and Italian uses your Latin-script voice, not language-specific detection.
- Your configured default voice is used as a fallback when no script-specific voice is set.

## Adding voices

### macOS

1. Open **System Settings/Preferences → Accessibility → Spoken Content**.
2. Click **System Voice → Manage Voices**.
3. Download additional voices for your target languages.

### Windows

1. Open **Settings → Time & Language → Speech**.
2. Under **Manage voices**, click **Add voices**.
3. Choose the languages you need.

### Mobile

Voices are managed in your device system settings (Accessibility or Language/Input).

## Tips

- For language learning, set the language to your **target** language rather than your native language to practise listening.
- Lower the speech rate when starting out with a new language, then increase it as you improve.
- Try different voices and keep the clearest one for long sessions.
