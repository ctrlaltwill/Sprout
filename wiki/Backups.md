## What backups are for

Backups save your **scheduling data** so you can recover from mistakes or bad imports.
They do not back up your note text.

## Create a backup

1. Open **Settings → Reset**.
2. Click **Create backup now**.

The backup is saved immediately.

## Restore a backup

1. In the backup table, find the backup you want.
2. Click **Restore**.
3. Confirm.

Restoring replaces current scheduling data with older data.

> [!WARNING]
> Restore overwrites your current scheduling state and review history.
> Reviews done after that backup was made are lost.

## Delete a backup

Click **Delete** next to a backup to remove it permanently.
This action cannot be undone.

## What is included

- card stages, intervals, stability, difficulty
- review history
- FSRS parameters
- card-to-note mappings

## What is not included

- Markdown note content
- media files
- plugin settings

## When to create backups

- before reset actions
- before large imports (see [[Anki Export & Import]])
- regularly as a safety habit
