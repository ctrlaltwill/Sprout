# Cards

Last modified: 13/02/2026

## Overview

Cards in Sprout are written inside your Markdown notes.
You can create cards by writing syntax directly or by using add-card forms.

## Card types

- [[Basic & Reversed Cards]]: direct question/answer recall
- [[Cloze Cards]]: fill-in-the-blank recall in context
- [[Image Occlusion]]: hide parts of images
- [[Multiple Choice Questions]]: choose the correct option
- [[Ordered Questions]]: remember sequences

## Create cards

Two methods:

1. write card syntax in notes
2. use **Add flashcard** from the context menu or command palette

See [[Creating Cards]], [[Reading View]], [[Reading View Styles]], and [[Custom Reading Styles]].

## Edit cards

You can edit cards:

- in the source note
- in [[Card Browser]]
- during review (edit action)

See [[Editing Cards]].

## Organize and format

- Use [[Groups]] to organize cards.
- Use [[Card Formatting]] for markdown, math, links, and images.

## Important behavior

- Broken or incomplete card syntax can cause cards to be skipped or parsed incorrectly.
- Card scheduling data is separate from note text (see [[Backups]]).
