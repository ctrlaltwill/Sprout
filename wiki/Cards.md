# Cards

Last updated: 13/02/2026

## Overview

Flashcards in Sprout live inside your Markdown notes as structured text blocks. You can create them by writing the syntax directly or by using the built-in creation modals. Sprout supports several card types to suit different kinds of knowledge.

## Card types

| Type | Best for | See |
|------|----------|-----|
| **Basic & Reversed** | Simple question → answer recall | [[Basic & Reversed Cards]] |
| **Cloze** | Fill-in-the-blank / active recall within context | [[Cloze Cards]] |
| **Image Occlusion** | Visual recall — diagrams, anatomy, maps | [[Image Occlusion]] |
| **Multiple Choice** | Recognition-based testing with options | [[Multiple Choice Questions]] |
| **Ordered Questions** | Sequence recall — steps, rankings, lists | [[Ordered Questions]] |

## Creating cards

There are two ways to create cards:

1. **Markdown syntax** — Write pipe-delimited card blocks directly in your notes. Great for speed and bulk creation.
2. **Creation modals** — Right-click in a note (or use the command palette) and choose **Add flashcard** to open a guided form. The modal inserts the formatted block for you.

See [[Creating Cards]] for full details on both methods.

## Editing cards

Cards can be edited in several ways:

- **In the source note** — Edit the Markdown directly or click the edit button in reading view.
- **From the Card Browser** — Select a card and click Edit.
- **During study** — Press `E` or choose Edit from the More menu to edit the card you're reviewing.

See [[Editing Cards]] for more.

## Formatting

Cards support inline Markdown (bold, italic, highlights), LaTeX equations, images, wikilinks, and more. See [[Card Formatting]].

## Organising cards

Use **groups** to tag and organise your cards into decks and sub-decks. Groups can be nested with commas for hierarchical organisation. See [[Groups]].

## Browsing

The [[Card Browser]] provides a searchable, sortable table of every card in your vault with filtering, bulk actions, and live editing.
