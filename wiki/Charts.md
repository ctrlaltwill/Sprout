## Overview

Charts in [[Analytics]] help you understand workload, progress, and retention.
Use filters first, then interpret chart changes.

## Review Calendar Heatmap

Shows one year of daily review activity.

- darker day = more reviews
- hover for exact date and count

Use it to spot streaks and missed days.

## Stage Distribution

Shows how cards are split across stages (New, Learning, Review, Relearning, Suspended).
More cards in Review usually means the collection is maturing.

## Future Due

Forecast of due cards over the next 30 days.
Use it to spot upcoming heavy days before they happen.

## Answer Buttons

30-day stacked view of grade choices (Again/Hard/Good/Easy).
Frequent **Again** can signal unclear cards or too much difficulty.

## New Cards Per Day

Shows how many new cards were added each day in the last 30 days.
Useful for balancing input rate vs review load.

## Stability Distribution

Histogram of stability values:

- low stability = short intervals
- high stability = longer intervals

Large low-stability clusters can indicate fragile recall.

## Forgetting Curve

Compares your real retention with the FSRS expected curve.
If real retention stays below expected, review [[Scheduling]] settings.

## Filter behavior and empty states

- Time and scope filters affect every chart.
- Narrow filters can make charts look empty.
- Empty charts usually mean no matching data, not data loss.
