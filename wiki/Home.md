## Welcome to Sprout

Sprout is an Obsidian plugin for creating and studying flashcards directly inside your Markdown notes. It uses the FSRS spaced-repetition algorithm to schedule reviews so you spend your time on the cards that need it most.

## Getting started

3. [[Study Sessions]] — start reviewing your cards

## What can Sprout do?

### Cards

Write flashcards in Markdown using a simple pipe-delimited syntax, or use the built-in creation modals. Sprout supports several card types:

- **Basic & Reversed** — classic question-and-answer cards
- **Cloze** — fill-in-the-blank deletion cards
- **Image Occlusion** — mask regions of an image and recall what's hidden
- **Multiple Choice** — choose the correct option from a list
- **Ordered Questions** — arrange items in the correct sequence

See [[Cards]] for a full overview.

### Studying

Review cards with intelligent scheduling powered by FSRS. Choose from two-button or four-button grading, practice mode, auto-advance, and more. See [[Study Sessions]].

### Analytics

Track your progress with streak counters, heatmaps, stage distribution charts, forgetting curves, and study forecasts. See [[Analytics]].

### Browsing

Search, filter, sort, and bulk-edit your entire card collection in the [[Card Browser]].

### Audio

Enable text-to-speech to have your cards read aloud. Configure voices and languages in [[Text to Speech|Text to Speech]].

### Import & Export

Exchange cards with Anki using `.apkg` files. See [[Anki Export & Import]].

## Quick start

1. Write cards in any note using pipe-delimited syntax (see [[Creating Cards]])
