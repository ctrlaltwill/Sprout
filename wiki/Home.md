## What is Sprout?

Sprout is an Obsidian plugin for making flashcards in your notes and reviewing them with spaced repetition (a system that shows cards again at the right time).

With Sprout, you can:

- Create flashcards directly in Markdown notes
- Review cards in study sessions
- Track progress in analytics
- Browse and edit cards in one place

## Start here

1. [[Installation]]
2. [[Creating Cards]]
3. [[Study Sessions]]

## Card types

- [[Basic & Reversed Cards]]
- [[Cloze Cards]]
- [[Image Occlusion]]
- [[Multiple Choice Questions]]
- [[Ordered Questions]]

See [[Cards]] for the full overview.

## Study basics

- Reviews are scheduled automatically using FSRS.
- You can study by vault, folder, note, or group.
- Daily new and review limits are applied per study scope and reset each day.
- Practice mode does not change scheduling.

See [[Study Sessions]], [[Scheduling]], and [[Grading]].

## Other tools

- [[Card Browser]] for search, filters, sorting, and bulk actions
- [[Analytics]] and [[Charts]] for progress tracking
- [[Text to Speech|Text to Speech]] for spoken cards
- [[Reading View]] for reviewing extracted content

## Important notes

- If card syntax is invalid, the card is quarantined until fixed.
- Some actions are permanent, including **Delete all flashcards** and reset actions.

Before large imports or resets, create a backup (see [[Backups]]).
