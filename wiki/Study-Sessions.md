# Study Sessions

## Starting a session

Open a deck from the **Home** view or tap the deck-tree widget and choose a scope:

| Scope | Covers |
|-------|--------|
| **Vault** | Every card in the vault |
| **Folder** | Cards in notes under a folder |
| **Note** | Cards in a single note |
| **Group** | Cards tagged with one or more groups |

Sprout loads due cards first (learning → relearning → review), then new cards. Cloze siblings and IO children from the same parent are automatically spaced apart.

## Daily limits

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Daily new limit | 20 | Max new cards introduced per scope per day |
| Daily review limit | 200 | Max due cards shown per scope per day |

Limits are tracked independently for each scope and reset at midnight.

## Answering cards

Reveal the answer, then rate how well you recalled it.

**Two-button mode** (default):

| Button | Shortcut | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Again | `1` | Forgot — card re-enters the learning queue |
| Good | `2` | Remembered |

**Four-button mode** (enable in Settings → Study):

| Button | Shortcut | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Again | `1` | Forgot |
| Hard | `2` | Recalled with difficulty |
| Good | `3` | Comfortable recall |
| Easy | `4` | Effortless |

Press **Space** or **Enter** to reveal the answer.

## Practice mode

Practice mode lets you review cards that are **not yet due** — useful for extra revision before an exam.

Cards are sorted closest-to-due first. Ratings in practice mode do not update scheduling.

## Timer

A session timer runs in the header showing elapsed time as `MM:SS` (or `HH:MM:SS` after one hour). Use the play / pause buttons to control it.

## Auto-advance

When enabled (Settings → Study), unanswered cards are automatically marked **Again** and advanced after a configurable delay (3–60 seconds, default 60). A countdown appears on screen.

## Skip

Enable the **Skip** button in Settings → Study. Pressing **Enter** skips the current card and pushes it further back in the queue. Skipping does **not** affect scheduling.

| Skip count | Behaviour |
|------------|-----------|
| 1st | Card moves back in queue |
| 2nd | Card moves further back |
| 3rd | A **"Bury for today?"** prompt appears |

At the bury prompt: press `B` to bury (postpone until tomorrow) or `Escape` to dismiss.

## More menu

Press `M` or tap the **⋮** button to open the More menu.

| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Bury | `B` | Postpone card until tomorrow |
| Suspend | `S` | Suspend card (remove from future reviews) |
| Undo | `U` | Revert the previous rating (only available on the next card) |
| Open note | `O` | Jump to the source note |
| Edit | `E` | Open the inline card editor |

Sprout records how long you spend on each card (capped at 5 minutes) and uses it for analytics.
