# Basic & Reversed Cards

Last modified: 13/02/2026

## Overview

Basic cards show a question first, then an answer.
Reversed cards add a second card automatically so you study both directions.

## Basic card format

```
T | Title |
Q | What is the capital of France? |
A | Paris |
I | Extra context |
G | Geography |
```

- Required fields: `Q` and `A`
- Optional fields: `T`, `I`, `G`

## Create with the modal

1. Right-click in a note.
2. Choose **Add flashcard → Basic Card**.
3. Fill in fields and save.

## Reversed behavior

With reverse enabled, Sprout creates:

1. Question → Answer
2. Answer → Question

Use the reverse option in the modal to enable this.

## Grading

After revealing the answer, grade your recall:

- two-button mode: Again / Good
- four-button mode: Again / Hard / Good / Easy

See [[Grading]].

## Edge cases and tips

- If `Q` or `A` is missing, the card cannot work correctly.
- Keep one fact per card for better retention.
- Use `I` for hints or references instead of making `A` too long.
- Use groups to organize by topic.
